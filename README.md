# Project of Crazy Thursday

**Project Title: Forecast of Credit Card Approval Based on Vintage Analysis**

Group name: Crazy Thursday

Group member: Miaoting Feng, Can Song


******
1) The original data set includes two csv files - application_record.csv and credit_record.csv.
   
   The credit_record table is uploaded in the csv form. However, the application_record is uploaded in the compressed format, which is the "credir_record.zip", since it is    too large.

2) The Rmd file is the process and result of how we applied multiple outlier detection methods to part of the application_record.csv.

   The pdf file named "Results of outlier detection" contains every result we runned from the Rmd file.

3) The ipynb files contain all the steps we have done in this project, including data preprocessing, brief analysis, model fitting and model performance.
   
   a) The "ESE527-Vintage analysis.ipynb" is about how we decide the standard of "bad" customers. Eventually we chose those who past due more than 60 days as "bad".
   
   b) The "ESE527-Credit card approval.ipynb" is about the brief data analysis, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, modeling, and validation processes. 
   

4) The py file is a copy of the "ESE527-Credit card approval.ipynb", in case the ipynb file fails to open and work properly.

5) The png files are the normalized confusion matrix reuslts of our models, in case the ipynv file fails to show the figures clearly.

   There should be three png files in total.

Can Song and Miaoting Feng both clicked the github link from "Tutorial for Github Setup.pdf" at Canvas on March 6. 
They then joined the Github organization of ESE527 SP2021 and failed to find ways out. 

So here our group will have the link based on the Github organization of WUSTL ESE527 SP2021.

Thank you for your understanding!
